is made by the customer and he needs the cloud to deploy it, IaaS is when the cloud vendor runs and manages the servers allowing 
the customers to create virtual machines that run on the vendors servers. 

2. The Azure Service Management deployment model is the legacy version of deploying services, and 
The resource manager deployment model is its replacement that also controls the resources. 

3. The difference is control planes control services and data planes simply manage the data.
